> **Part of the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) open-source 6-agent marketing stack.**
> Autonomous short-form social posting + online-reputation management across YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X/Twitter, and LinkedIn — with a human-in-the-loop approval gate before anything goes public.

The agent scans configured signal sources, drafts a caption + script tuned to each platform's conventions, generates the video, and queues the finished post for approval. ORM mentions on watched accounts get drafted responses gated to operator approval too.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nuraveda-lab/ai-social-agent.git
# or: git clone https://codeberg.org/Nuraveda_lab/ai-social-agent.git
cd ai-social-agent

uv pip install -e .          # or: pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env         # platform tokens + LLM keys + video provider
alembic upgrade head

python -m social_signal.server
```

## What it does

- **Scout** — periodically scans configured sources for new content signals worth posting about.
- **Script writer** — LLM generates a caption + script for each signal, matched to platform conventions (length, hashtags, tone).
- **Video pipeline** — pluggable video generation (Kling, Veo, fal.ai) with caption burn-in.
- **Publisher** — uploads finished media to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X, LinkedIn with proper metadata.
- **ORM** — listens for mentions/replies on watched accounts, drafts responses, optional auto-reply within guardrails.
- **Sheet-driven pacing** — one post per (brand × platform) per N hours, daily cap configurable.

## The HITL pattern (shared across the stack)

Every action that touches brand voice or public delivery routes through a human-in-the-loop approval gate. Posts are drafted, queued, and only publish after explicit operator approval. ORM replies follow the same pattern — never an auto-reply on a sensitive thread without sign-off. The audit log records who approved what, when, on which channel.
